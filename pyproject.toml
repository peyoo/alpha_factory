# Notes:
# - pyproject.toml keeps the packages that pip probe shows as installable/importable.
# - Packages that failed pip install or were forced to Conda (e.g. ta-lib, cvxpy, pyarrow,
#   scikit-learn variants, sympy in some cases) are placed into environment.yml's Conda deps.
# - After conda audit we will reconcile and, if safe, move some back to Poetry-managed deps.
